# CheckBeer

CheckBeer is an anti-tampering Android library designed to protect the integrity and security of your app by detecting common signature bypass and tampering techniques.

> [!NOTE]
> Even though CheckBeer provides enhanced security, it is not a silver bullet. It is essential to follow security best practices and regularly update your app to maintain security effectiveness.
